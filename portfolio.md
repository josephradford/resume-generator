## Employment

### 1. Team Leader, Application Software; Saluda Medical Sydney; August 2020 – May 2025

I was promoted to this role after demonstrating leadership at the start of the Clarity® Programming Application v2.0 project. My responsibilities across all projects in this position included:

- Implemented Agile/Scrum for the first time at Saluda Medical, running ceremonies including planning, retrospective, points poker, showcase, and daily stand-ups.

- Optimised development with platform engineering practices using Jira to manage incoming work, Bitbucket for coding and pull requests, and Bamboo for automated testing.

- Improved coding review practices amongst the team through retrospectives and focused meetings to accelerate reviews, responses, and differences of opinion.

- Reviewing code and unit tests across all projects listed below.

- Reduced bugs in development by implementing DevOps and DevSecOps practices through automated testing on Bamboo that included code coverage, linters, unit tests, system tests that incorporated a real Saluda stimulator, and static application security testing tools ReSharper and Klocwork.

- Worked closely with the Software Test team, reviewing their automated tests (written in Gherkin and Robot Framework), integrating their tests into our DevOps pipelines, and reviewing their formal verification protocols and reports.

- Designed release management strategy for internal development and alpha releases and release candidates, based on Gitflow workflow, with different build and test conditions, and following semantic versioning.

- Worked closely with the Firmware team as new features were introduced in the stimulator and the communications protocol reflected these changes.

- Gathered feedback in showcases from a wide range of stakeholders including Clinical, Systems, Regulatory, Quality, and Project Management.

- Implemented Saluda Medical's formalised Design and Development process and IEC 62304 as the Software Development Lifecycle for this product, owning the deliverables of each project (Software Development Plan, Configuration Management Plan, Release Notes, SOUP (Software of Unknown Provenance) Analysis, DFMEA (Design Failure Mode and Effects Analysis), Requirements and managing Detailed Design, Architecture and Source Code).

#### 1. Clarity® Programming Application v3.0; 2024 – 2025

- Continuation of Clarity® Programming Application v2.3.2 and v2.3.0.
- Updates for compatibility with new hardware, firmware, and communications protocol with authentication and authorisation.
- Updated the CI/CD pipelines and developer's environments to use Docker for building and unit tests, improving DevOps practices.

#### 2. Clarity® Programming Application v2.3.2; 2024 – 2025

- Continuation of Clarity® Programming Application v2.3.0 and v2.2.6.
- Internationalisation and localisation of the application for Dutch, French, German, Spanish and Swedish for both the Clarity Programming Application and the RECAP Viewer.
- Feature toggles for being able to toggle support for the new stimulation lead type compatibility added in the previous project.
- Managed an offshore team of two engineers for this release.
- Complex release management as this was being built on top of a release that was still in progress (v2.3.0); this was managed with feature toggles, sophisticated DevOps infrastructure and thorough communication with other workstreams.
- Used Copilot to create a Python script that automated some of the documentation formatting required as part of Saluda's Design and Development process.
- Conceived and implemented the sunsetting of low-value features that were creating overheads in anomaly management and testing.

#### 3. Clarity® Programming Application v2.3.0; 2023 – 2024

- Continuation of Clarity® Programming Application v2.2.6.
- Added support for a new hardware (stimulation lead type) connected to the stimulator.
- From feedback I provided in the previous project, a product owner role was assigned to one of the senior members of the software team. This role served as a bridge between the engineers and the stakeholders to elicit requirements and perform design work for the new lead type support in the software.
- I introduced software estimation techniques to the team from my Software Estimation Training certification. As a result, the team was able to take ownership of the deadline based on the estimates, work sustainably, and be the first software project at Saluda to be delivered on time.
- With the regulatory team, I adapted the team's workflow to the new FDA guidance for medical devices which required changes to Software Development Plans and architecture documents.
- Working with the legal team, I updated requirements and design for trademark and registered marks for branding in the UI.
- Working with the legal team, I undertook an audit of the third-party software libraries used by all software at Saluda to ensure there were no copyleft licenses or libraries that needed to be paid for. As a result, for this release, certain libraries needed to be purchased and others needed to be fixed to a particular version, as later version had changed licenses.
- Third-party libraries were also audited for vulnerabilities and were updated to their latest versions where possible, and I updated the Software Development Plan to mention third-party library selection based on FDA "updatability and patchability" criteria.
- Began to use Netrise tool from this project onwards to break down applications into their SBOMs and track new vulnerabilities in these libraries.

#### 4. Saludemy; 2023 – 2025

- A weekly learning session for the software team where topics would be taught by colleagues within the team and from adjacent teams.
- This project was my initiative, and I convinced senior management to let me start and continue it.
- I scheduled over 50 sessions, arranged speakers and catering, and curated recordings and materials on Notion.
- This project was a response to feedback from the team about spreading technical knowledge around team members and improving knowledge on the medical and scientific side of the business and improving knowledge on medical device regulatory matters.
- I also initiated "whoami" sessions where senior leaders in the company could come in and talk about their background and their role in the company, which improved communication and respect in both directions between management and the engineers.
- I gathered feedback periodically using Microsoft Forms on how the helpful the sessions were, and addressed these concerns (for example, we stopped using pre-recorded sessions from industry webinars when there was no speaker that week, as it was not engaging enough).
- Overall, this project was a big success to encourage a culture of sustainable performance.

#### 5. Clarity® Programming Application v2.2.6; 2023 – 2024

- Remediation of the work submitted in Clarity® Programming Application v2.2.2, which was not approved by the FDA.
- Ran enhanced sprints across two periods of intense work to get the submission approved:
  1. Rewrite the residual anomalies in the submission; divided the anomalies amongst the team; trained the team how to write the anomaly investigation; take the anomalies to the review board and cycle any feedback to the team.
  2. Fix the residual anomalies; explain the solutions and any side effects from the team to the review board; review the tests created for the fixed anomalies.
- Updated all documentation (design, release notes) to reflect this work and resubmit to the FDA.

#### 6. Clarity® Programming Application v2.2.2 2021 – 2022

- Continuation of work in Clarity® Programming Application v2.1
